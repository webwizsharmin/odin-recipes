    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ large zucchinis, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>21 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups low-carb marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.</li><br>
        <li>Pat dry zucchini slices with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>Place chicken on skewers; arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until almost cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Make sauce: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garam masala. When masala begins to crackle, mix in ginger paste, garlic, and green chile pepper. Sauté until tender, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in tomato purée, water, chili powder, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring in honey and fenugreek.</li><br>
        <li>Remove par-cooked chicken from skewers and place into sauce in the pan. Continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stir in cream until incorporated.</li><br>
