    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A popular Indian dish featuring chicken cooked in a spiced tomato and butter-based gravy.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, divided</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make marinade: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chili powder, and salt; stir to evenly coat chicken. Cover the dish and let marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.</li><br>
        <li>Line a strainer with cheesecloth. Place yogurt in the strainer and allow it to drain for 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer drained yogurt to a medium bowl. Mix remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oil, garlic paste, ginger paste, melted butter, remaining 1 tablespoon chili powder, and garam masala into yogurt until well combined. Pour yogurt mixture over chicken, cover the dish, and refrigerate once more to marinate for 3 to 4 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>Place chicken on skewers; arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until almost cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Make sauce: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garam masala. When masala begins to crackle, mix in ginger paste, garlic, and green chile pepper. Sauté until tender, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in tomato purée, water, chili powder, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring in honey and fenugreek.</li><br>
        <li>Remove par-cooked chicken from skewers and place into sauce in the pan. Continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stir in cream until incorporated.</li><br>
